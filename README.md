# HMRF-EM Image Segmentation (Python Version)

This project is a Python translation of the original MATLAB implementation of the HMRF-EM algorithm developed by Quan Wang in 2012. The algorithm combines **Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF)** with the **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** method to perform unsupervised image segmentation.

The original MATLAB code was released by Quan Wang on April 25, 2012, and has been faithfully converted to Python by **Saeid Moradi** on January 28, 2022.

## Features

- Python implementation of the HMRF-EM algorithm
- Includes a demo for testing and visualizing the segmentation results
- Based on the original research paper and MATLAB code
